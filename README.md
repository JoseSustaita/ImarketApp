## About The Project

[WireFrame](https://www.figma.com/file/cFh2XL7ibFmmMVbU2zvdoS/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

I Market is a marketplace made for my small town of Immokalee located in SouthWest Florida. Our town has a population of about 8000 and this app can be used for people to list or buy items that they no longer need. Our Moto is "Discover Lost Treasure" because you never know what you can find on the app.
